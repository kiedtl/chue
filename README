# chue

a cat(1) for colors.

This project is mostly intended to test out some of my ideas:

- linked list and vector implementation.
- error handling with sum types (e.g. Rust's `Result<T, E>`)
- a non-null-terminated string.

A lot of code is experimental; expect to find some pretty
atrocious code here.
