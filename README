# chue

a cat(1) for colors.

---

This project was originally intended to test out some of my ideas:

- linked list and vector implementation.
- error handling with sum types (e.g. Rust's `Result<T, E>`)
- a non-null-terminated string.

Alas, most of the code is neither well written nor well tested.
Expect to find bugs, snakes, and dead bunnies.

If you need **advanced** functionality, the author would highly
recommend [pastel](https://github.com/sharkdp/pastel) instead.
chue is OK for simple things, though.

## installation

If you still want to install this monstrosity, you'll need `make`
and a C99 compiler.

Then:

```
$ make
# install -Dm755 ./chue /usr/local/bin/chue
```

See `./chue -h` for usage information.
